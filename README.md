In order for success compilation:

-Rename "DuoKeys.Template" to "DuoKeys.properties"
 And Make sure you chuck in your own DUO integration iKeys, sKeys, hKeys
-Rename log4j-example.properties to log4j.properties

IDE I used to Compile: NetBeans 7.x
The Project uses Maven.

I locked the Registration/Management portion of the Web pages with simple Spring Form Security.
